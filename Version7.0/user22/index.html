                    <h1>WHO IS THE GOAT???</h1>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When talking about GOAT, Michael Jordan is a name so accustomed to being on the top list. It’s no wonder given the performances he always shows every time NBA seasons are up.

                            For instance, what sets him apart from most of the people on this list is his perfect NBA Finals record. With his standing of 6-0, where he dominated and won MVP in 6 Finals in two various 3-peats, this name can’t be missed.</li>
                        <li>Lebron James is also a huge name in NBA’s basketball history. He’s even popular for having more game-winning buzzer-beaters during the playoffs than any player in the history of the NBA – even more than the stats of both Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan combined.

                            He leads the scoring among all the active players and is the only player with more than 9,000 career points in NBA history.
                            
                            He was called “The King” for obvious reasons, and is the player that gets the most prop bets in online NBA sportsbooks.</li>
                        <li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is also considered the NBA's GOAT. In fact, this is also what the former Lakers coach and currently Miami Heat President Pat Riley remarked.
                                    If you add up his 3 college titles, his 3 Final Four Most Outstanding Players awards, and among his other achievements, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar can easily be included in the GOAT list.
                                    <ol>
                                        
                                            
                                                                           
                                    
                                    
                                
                                <li>Kobe Bryant is considered one of the most clutch players of all time. He’s a great defender and was able to elevate his team during the times it mattered the most. He has 36-game wins which are the most by any player throughout NBA history. 

                                    That makes the Black Mamba a relevant choice for a GOAT like Kobe..</li>
                                <li>.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Despite having his career peak decades ago, Wilt Chamberlain still makes a mark as one of the NBA’s Greatest of All Time.

                            Chamberlain wasn't just the fastest but he was also the strongest player that’s ever set foot in NBA courts. He’s the only player to score 4,000 points in one season. He also set NBA single-game records with the highest points (100), as well as the most consecutive field goals (18) and the most rebounds</li>
                        <li>Larry Bird, or the Celtics legend, is one of the most admired players up until today because of his wisdom in playing, competitiveness, and his all-around ability in doing anything inside the court.

                            Bird won 3 straight MVP awards, making him the only player to have accomplished the feat in league history. He also brought back the then struggling Celtics in the 80s to its glory days.</li>
                    </ol>
